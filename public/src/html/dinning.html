                        In the heart of the Gold Room, our speakeasy-style bar serves a tantalizing array of classic cocktails.
                        Crafted by expert mixologists, our drinks menu features timeless favorites like the Manhattan and the
                        Martini, alongside our signature creations inspired by the Roaring Twenties. Sip on a Sidecar as you
                        soak in the ambiance, surrounded by the original 1920s décor, including authentic Tiffany lamps and

                        Our dinner service in the Gold Room is a culinary journey through time. Executive Chef Emily Carter
                        has masterfully created a menu that revives the spirit and flavors of the 1920s with a modern twist.
                        Indulge in luxurious dishes such as Oysters Rockefeller, Chateaubriand, and Waldorf Salad, all prepared
                        with locally sourced ingredients and served on fine china. The opulent setting, complete with crystal
                        chandeliers and gold-leaf accents, provides the perfect backdrop for a sumptuous dining experience.

                        As night falls, the Gold Room comes alive with the sounds of jazz and swing. Our stage has hosted some
                        of the most renowned jazz musicians of the era, and today, we continue this tradition. Dance the night
                        away to a live band playing the hits of the 1920s, from Duke Ellington to Louis Armstrong, in an
                        atmosphere charged with excitement and nostalgia. The grand piano, a centerpiece of the room, often
                        features surprise performances, adding to the magic of your evening.
