                        with locally sourced ingredients and served on fine china. The opulent setting, complete with crystal
                        chandeliers and gold-leaf accents, provides the perfect backdrop for a sumptuous dining experience.

                        As night falls, the Gold Room comes alive with the sounds of jazz and swing. Our stage has hosted some
                        of the most renowned jazz musicians of the era, and today, we continue this tradition. Dance the night
                        away to a live band playing the hits of the 1920s, from Duke Ellington to Louis Armstrong, in an
                        atmosphere charged with excitement and nostalgia. The grand piano, a centerpiece of the room, often
                        features surprise performances, adding to the magic of your evening.
