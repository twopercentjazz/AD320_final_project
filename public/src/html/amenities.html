                        of discovery and the allure of the Overlook's storied past. Join us, and lose yourself in the enchantment

                    <p>
                        Designed by renowned landscape artist Edward Carver, the maze spans over three
                        acres, with walls of lush greenery standing over six feet high.
                        Its design is inspired by the grand mazes of European estates, yet with a distinctive twist that reflects
                        the unique spirit of the Overlook. As guests wander its paths, they encounter a series of enchanting
                        surprises: serene resting nooks, sculptures hidden amongst the foliage, and occasional glimpses of the
                        hotel's majestic fa√ßade.

                    <p>
                        Conceived in the early 20th century, the maze's history is as rich and intriguing as the hotel itself.
                        Commissioned by the original owner,
                        Gerald Fordham, it was intended as a tranquil retreat for guests seeking solitude and inspiration. Over
                        the decades, it has been the site of numerous high-profile events, including garden parties, literary
                        gatherings, and even a few cinematic shoots.
